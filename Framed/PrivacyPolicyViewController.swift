<h2>Fair Information Practices</h2>

<p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>

<p><strong>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</strong></p>
<ul>
<p><strong>We will notify you via email:</strong></p>
<li>Within 7 business days.</li>
<p><strong>We will notify the users via in-site notification:</strong></p>
<li>Within 7 business days.</li>
</ul>

<p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>

<h2>CAN SPAM Act</h2>

<p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>

<p><strong>We collect your email address in order to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.</li>
<li>rocess orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders.</li>
<li>Send you additional information related to your product and/or service.</li>
<li>Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To be in accordance with CAN-SPAM, we agree to the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</li>
<li>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.</li>
<li>Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</li>
<li>Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.</li>
<li>Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.</li>
</ul>
